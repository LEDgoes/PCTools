This is the Python source code for the LEDgoes PC Tools application.  You can run it as follows:

python LEDgoesPCInterface.py

The current version doesn't work.  It generates exceptions when trying to write messages over the serial connection.  This should be fixed with a couple hours' work.

Requirements/Dependencies:
* Qt5
And possibly others...

Enhancement Wishlist:
* Animations (GIF, BMP frames, AVI movies)
* Read from a Twitter feed
* Read from an RSS feed
* Proper Rich Text box to handle different fonts & colors in the same message
* Implementation of control signals understood by the firmware to change the serial baud rate & do debugging/development
