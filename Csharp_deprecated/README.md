This C# code is unsupported and no longer actively maintained.  It may help enable Windows users get started using the LED matrix quickly, but it is definitely rough around the edges; it's missing key features and does not handle errors well.

This entire folder corresponds to the "LEDgoes PC Tools.sln" MSVC 2010 solution file; if you download this whole folder, you can open everything in Visual Studio.

There are three applications in this folder, as you can see above, each in their own sub-folder.  The executables for each can be found in (sub-folder name)/bin/Debug/(application name).exe.  These executables will require MSVC 4.0 Runtime to be installed.  (It is 4.0, right? And not 4.5?)
